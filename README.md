Media Cloud Providers Library
=============================

A package of search providers for Media Cloud. This used to support many different types of data sources
for fetching content, but not is primarily an internal library for accessing the Media Cloud Online News
Archive (ElasticSearch index). Accordingly, eeleases > 4.0.0 are all be shared exclusively on github, and 
this project was delisted from pypi around April 2025.

Install with pip (`pip install .`) and the `install.sh` script. 

Requires environment variables set for various interfaces to work correctly.

4. Push the tag to GitHub
5. GitHub action will build and push the repository on committing a tagged version
